# SwoleLuigi
ACMD and script mod for Swole Luigi

The arguments for the camera function are as follows:
CAM_ZOOM_IN_arg5(ZoomSpeed, ObjectFocus, ZoomAmount, VerticalRotation, HorizontalRotation)

--ZoomSpeed is how many frames it takes for it to zoom in all the way, not how long the zoom lasts

--ObjectFocus is probably best not being messed with

--The lower the ZoomAmount, the further away the camera will be. I used 2.0 for Swole Luigi

--Vertical and Horizontal rotation don't go by degrees, not sure what they use. ex: 1.0 Horizontal rotation almost places the camera perpendicular to its default
